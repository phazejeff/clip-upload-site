# Simple Clip Uploader

This is a simple clip uploader designed to work with Discord embeds.

Discord recently changed their maximum upload file limit to a mere 10 mb, so I created this simple, self-hostable app to upload more. On top of that, Discord does not support AV1 compression, despite it being far superior to H.264.

## Usage
The recommended usage is via docker. The repo has a sample [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml)
